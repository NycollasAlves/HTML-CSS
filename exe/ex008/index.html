        Albert%20Einstein%20is,the%20universe%20works.">Albert Einstein is the most influential physicist of the 
        20th century, and just might be the most famous scientist to have ever lived. He was 
        only 26 when in 1905, he had four separate papers published, electrifying the field o
        f physics and propelling him to global renown. Among his famous works were his 
        ground-breaking special theory of relativity, as well as his famous equation, E = 
        mc², which asserted that matter could be turned into energy. Not since Isaac Newton 
        had one man so drastically altered our understanding 
        of how the universe works.</blockquote></p>
